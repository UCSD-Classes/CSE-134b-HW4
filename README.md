## Notes

Use the "Labs" button at the top to navigate to HW4 pages.

Javascript Modules weren't used because whenever I tried to use them,
I would get an error saying that different functions were undefined even
though I made sure to export them before they were callled.

Native Dialogs is done in nativedialogs.html

Custom Dialogs is done in customdialogs.html and customdialog.js

CRUD is done in crud.html and blog.js

Styled CRUD is done in styledcrud.html and styledblog.js
